# Practical guide for a happy life in Prague

The mission of prg.ai is to transform Prague into an artificial intelligence hub of global significance. A thriving community of international researchers and academics who bring the essential dose of diversity of thought, experience, backgrounds and networks is an indispensable ingredient in achieving our ambitious goal.

From our personal experience we know how costly moving to a foreign country can be in terms of time, energy, and money. It was the findings of the prg.ai survey carried out in autumn 2019 among 40 international staff members of our academic founders that clearly indicated a real need for a handbook, which would provide relevant information to make the relatively demanding process of city discovery and settling down as smooth and painless as possible.

The resulting piece is this Practical Guide for a Happy Life in Prague. It strives to cover all areas of importance and possible concern such as living costs, accommodation, public transportation, medical care, shopping, various apps and much more. It also includes tips, tricks and recommendations not only from the prg.ai team but, more importantly, from the researchers themselves. It is a result of a true collaborative effort, for which we are very grateful to all the respondents of the survey and specifically to the following, who subsequently devoted further time and insight in 1:1 sessions:

* Maria Saumell (Combinatorial Group, CS, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic & FIT, Czech Technical University)       
* Maria Jose Erquiaga (Department of Computer Science, FEE, Czech Technical University)
* Tobias Rittig (Computer Graphics Group, MFF, Charles University)
* Niklas Heim (Department of Computer Science, FEE, Czech Technical University)
* Giorgos Tolias (Center for Machine Perception, FEE, Czech Technical University)
* Alex Kovalenko (Programming Research Lab, FIT, Czech Technical University)
* Ramesh Kumar Jallu (Department of Theoretical Computer Science, CS, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic) 
* Konrad Siek (Programming Research Lab, FIT, Czech Technical University)
* Fabio Vito Difonzo (Department of Computer Science, FEE, Czech Technical University)
* Matas Šileikis (Department of Theoretical Computer Science, CS, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic) 
* Shadi Saleh (Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, MFF, Charles University)
* Vahideh Keikha (Department of Theoretical Computer Science, CS, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic) 

We prepared the guide with the international researcher in mind, but needless to say, we sincerely hope it will become a solid source of information and advice to anyone who is considering moving to our beautiful capital or is already here and still feels a tad lost at times. Our plan is to transform the document into a wiki on our upcoming website so it’s widely accessible and anyone can help us in our effort to keep it relevant and up to date. It’s in comment mode, so feel free to suggest your advice and tips!
