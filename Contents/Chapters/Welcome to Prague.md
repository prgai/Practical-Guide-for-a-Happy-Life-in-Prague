<h3>ü§ó Welcome to Prague</h4>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</a> is the capital and the largest city in the Czech Republic. Its rich history attracts visitors from all over the world, and UNESCO lists the historic city centre as a <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/616/">World Heritage Site</a>. 

Did you know that Prague Castle is <a href="https://www.archute.com/prague-castle-largest-castle-world/">the largest castle in the world</a>?

Yet, it‚Äôs not only a popular tourist destination. Prague has become home to an <a href="https://kafkadesk.org/2019/04/29/who-are-the-foreigners-living-in-the-czech-republic/">expanding community of expats</a> due to its many assets, be it the location in the heart of Europe, which makes it an ideal base from which to explore the rest of the diverse continent, or the overall quality of life.

The Czech Republic has consistently ranked among the <a href="https://kafkadesk.org/2020/08/03/czech-republic-among-best-countries-in-the-world-to-raise-a-family-says-new-ranking/">top ten safest places on Earth</a> and the <a href="https://www.asherfergusson.com/raising-a-family-index/">top ten places to raise a family</a> according to safety, happiness, cost, health, education, and time indices. Prague offers all that, along with a vast cultural scene, dynamic nightlife, and <a href="https://news.expats.cz/weekly-czech-news/prague-is-the-worlds-greenest-urban-space-says-new-index/">expansive greenery</a>. And those are only a few of the reasons why you might be excited to experience life in the Czech metropolis.

<h4>What do our interviewees like about living in Prague?</h4>

> ‚ÄúMy primary motivation was that I knew my colleagues and I wanted to work with them since the quality of research is very good.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúPrague is a very multi-faceted city. People come here to party, you have tons of cultural activities with museums, exhibitions, etc. and a wide variety of sporting possibilities. I myself like the outgoing nature/enthusiasm of most Czech people and the good food.‚Äù
	
<h4>And what do they not like as much?</h4>

> ‚ÄúSome of the local people are very nice and friendly, others refuse to speak English.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThe biggest challenge that I faced was to find suitable accommodation. This should be settled as early as possible, otherwise it can become quite a torture. Because unless you have a suitable apartment and accommodation contract, you can't apply for a visa for your family.‚Äù
