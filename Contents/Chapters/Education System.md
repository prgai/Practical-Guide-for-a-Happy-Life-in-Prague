## üìö Education system

For detailed information about the education system in the Czech Republic, take a look at [this structured article](https://www.euraxess.cz/czech-republic/information-assistance/rodina/p%C3%A9%C4%8De-o-d%C4%9Bti-p%C5%99ed%C5%A1koln%C3%ADho-v%C4%9Bku/education-system) by [Euraxess](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Czech_Republic). If you are looking for some help, there is an organisation called [META](https://meta-ops.eu/what-are-we-doing-who-do-we-help/) which provides help to ‚Äúparents with migration experience and their children to orientate themselves in the Czech education system and in their integration into society‚Äù.

Here are the most important points from the article by Euraxess:

### Elementary school (primary and lower secondary education, ages 6‚Äì15)

- The next step for a child after home-care and/or pre-school is elementary school. Schools will enrol children who are six years old by September 1st. **By law, all children must attend school for 9 years.** This legal requirement applies to Czech citizens, EU/EEA citizens, citizens of third countries who have permanent or long-term residence in the Czech Republic, and asylum seekers.
- The school year begins on 1st September and ends on 31st August. Summer holidays are in July and August and shorter school holidays are in the autumn, at Christmas, at the end of the first semester, and at Easter.
- Education at public and state-funded elementary schools is free of charge.
- Pupils' achievements in the Czech Republic are graded on a scale from 1 (best) to 5 (worst). Twice in every school year ‚Äì in the middle and at the end ‚Äì pupils receive an overall report with a summary of their grades for each subject (this is called a vysvƒõdƒçen√≠).

### Secondary school (upper secondary education, ages 16‚Äì19)

- Most secondary schools are public (state-funded), although some are private or church-supported. Tuition at secondary schools is free at public (state-funded) schools, while private schools may charge fees.
- Students are accepted to secondary schools after successfully completing their elementary (obligatory) education. They may also be required to sit an entrance exam or admissions test before being accepted to the school of their choice.
- Pupils are assessed throughout the year and at the end of the year, and receive an overall assessment of their progress. Study at most secondary schools culminates in the "maturita" school leaving exam for which a diploma is issued. In some programmes without "maturita", such as vocational programmes, pupils are issued a certificate and educational transcript after completing their final year. 

### Tertiary education

- After completing secondary education with the ‚Äúmaturita‚Äù exam, students can continue with tertiary education provided by universities (higher education institutions that engage in research), "vysok√© ≈°koly" (higher education institutions that don‚Äôt engage in research) and by "vy≈°≈°√≠ odborn√© ≈°koly", which are vocational colleges of further education.
- Degree-level education is provided by universities (which offer courses at Bachelor, Master and Doctoral level), and by other higher education institutions, which often offer only Bachelor level courses. The majority of universities are public, state-funded institutions; a few universities and most other higher education institutions which are approved by the Ministry of Education are private. 
- Study is free at public (state-funded) universities and institutions (although fees may be charged for administrative processing of applications, for extension of study beyond the standard time period, for study on a second or further course, and for study in a foreign language ‚Äì including English). Private institutions can charge study fees.

### International schools

There are a number of [international primary and secondary schools](https://www.expats.cz/en/prague/directory/international-schools) that offer either bilingual education or fully foreign-language programmes. We have received a recommendation for the [Path to Success International School (Cesta k √∫spƒõchu)](https://www.cestakuspechu.cz/). Many Czech universities offer English programmes and there are a number of [private English-language higher education institutions](https://www.expats.cz/en/prague/directory/universities) that offer US-accredited degrees.
