## üá®üáø About the Czech Republic 

## Geography

**The Czech Republic is a landlocked country situated in Central Europe** and neighbours with Austria to the south, Germany to the west, Poland to the northeast and Slovakia to the southeast. It consists of three historical regions ‚Äî Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia. Czech landscape is quite varied with mountains, hills, forests, rivers and lakes. The highest mountain is Snƒõ≈æka (1,603m/5,259 ft. above sea level), located on the Czech-Polish border. There are four national parks in the Czech Republic ‚Äî Krkono≈°e (founded in 1963, it‚Äôs the oldest national park in the Czech Republic), Podyj√≠, ≈†umava (the largest national park with 680.64km sq/262.80 sq mi of land) and ƒåesk√© ≈†v√Ωcarsko. The Main European Watershed passes through the Czech Republic, draining the river Labe directly into the North Sea, the river Morava into the Danube and then to the Black Sea, and the Odra directly into the Baltic Sea.

## Climate

The Czech Republic has a moderate continental climate and the four seasons are noticeably distinct. The coldest month is usually January and during winter, there is an abundance of snow in the mountains and sometimes in the larger cities too. During spring, temperatures get warmer and the weather becomes more unpredictable ‚Äî especially in April, when temperatures can change notably during the course of one day. The warmest month of the year is usually July. Autumn begins in September, which is still relatively warm before temperatures begin to drop quite rapidly in October.

These are the usual temperatures for every season: 

Winter (December, January, February) **-5 to 10 ¬∞C (23 - 50 ¬∞F)**

Spring (March, April, May) **10 to 25 ¬∞C (50 - 77 ¬∞F)**

Summer (June, July, August) **20 to 35 ¬∞C (68 - 95 ¬∞F)**

Autumn (September, October, November) **5 to 18 ¬∞C (41 - 64 ¬∞F)**

### History

There is a [great structured article on the Lonely Planet website](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/czech-republic/a/nar/34b0fac8-8dad-4be7-89f1-ccb4923cf540/358820) about the history of the Czech Republic. For a greater understanding of Czech society, we especially recommend to read the sections on **WWI & Czech Independence, A Taste of Freedom, Nazi Domination** and **Velvet Revolution & Divorce**. 

### Political system

The Czech Republic is a **unitary parliamentary constitutional republic**. **The President** is the formal head of state with limited powers, elected by a direct vote for a term of five years (for a maximum of two successive terms in office). **The Prime Minister** is the head of government and wields considerable powers, including the right to set the agenda for most foreign and domestic policies, mobilise the parliamentary majority, and choose governmental ministers. **The Parliament** consists of two chambers ‚Äî **the Chamber of Deputies** (200 members) and **the Senate** (81 members). It passes all bills valid in the territory of the Czech Republic and expresses approval of important international agreements, for example those concerning human rights and basic liberties. 

You can find detailed information about current [political parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_Czech_Republic#Political_parties_and_elections) and the [executive branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_Czech_Republic#Executive_branch) on [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_Czech_Republic). 

### Language

The official language of the Czech Republic is Czech, which falls within the Slavic language group. A typical feature of the Czech language is the use of diacritics ‚Äî ‚Äúsmall hooks‚Äù (carons ‚Äî like in the word ≈°kola/school) and ‚Äúdashes‚Äù (acute accents ‚Äî like in the word n√°rodn√≠/national) written above the letters. 

Knowledge of English among Czechs is improving, especially among the younger generations. When you stop someone on the street for quick advice, you may be luckier with a younger person; older people are more likely to understand Russian. The situation is better in big cities, such as Prague and Brno. So, if you are thinking about living in the Czech Republic, you may want to consider a basic Czech language course. Employees of restaurants, banks and larger shops in Prague will likely understand at least basic English words, but you unfortunately cannot expect the same from landlords and administrative workers in public offices.

If you have helpful Czech friends or colleagues, do not hesitate to ask them to accompany you to the Foreign Police, appointments regarding accommodation and other administrative matters.

### Currency

The official currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech crown, abbreviated as Kƒç (koruna ƒçesk√°) or internationally as CZK. 

1 EUR = approx. 27 CZK

1 USD = approx. 24 CZK

1 GBP = approx. 30 CZK

You can use your credit or debit card in all supermarkets and most restaurants in Prague but it might be a good idea to carry some cash with you when going to smaller shops or pubs. ATMS are easily accessible in most neighbourhoods, but make sure to use official bank-owned ATMs as opposed to Euronet ATMs that charge high fees and have poor currency conversion rates.

### Population 

The population of the Czech Republic is approximately 10.7 million people (July 2020). Over 1 million people live in the capital city Prague. You can find the current data [here](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/czech-republic-population/). 

### Visa and residence permit

**Citizens of the EU, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland** can temporarily stay in the Czech Republic without any special permit, solely on the basis of a travel document or an identity card.

One of the obligations ensuing from the Act on the Residence of Foreign Nationals for citizens of the EU, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, or Switzerland is the "reporting requirement" in the event that the length of the intended stay in the Czech Republic is longer than 30 days. In this situation, within 30 days of entering the Czech Republic, an individual is required to report his/her presence to the appropriate Foreign Police Department that holds jurisdiction in the location of his/her stay in the Czech Republic.

If visitors intend to stay in the Czech Republic for longer than 3 months, they can request a [certificate of temporary residence](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21672749&doctype=ART) to be issued. You can apply for a [permanent residence](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21672632&docType=ART&chnum=1) permit after 5 years of continuous temporary residence in the Czech Republic.

**Non-EU nationals** are citizens of countries neither members of the EU, nor citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, nor their family members. The term used in legislation for this group is **third country nationals**. 

Conditions to third country nationals for entry to the Schengen Area (crossing external borders) include:

- Have a valid travel document.
- Have a valid [short-term visa](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21672767&doctype=ART) (maximum of 90 days) or [long-term visa](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21673057&doctype=ART) (over 90 days), if required, or a valid [long-term permanent residence](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21673122&doctype=ART).
- Declare the purpose and conditions of their intended stay.
- Have guaranteed sufficient funds for living expenses both for the duration of their intended stay, and for their return to their country of origin or for passage to a third country which guarantees to accept them, or else they are capable of legally acquiring such funds.
- Not be persons appearing in the Schengen information system (SIS II) as persons to be denied entry.
- Not be considered a threat to public order, internal security, public health or international relations of any member state; especially not persons who, according to the internal member state database, should be denied entry for the same grounds.
