### Healthcare system in the Czech Republic

On the following links you will find a useful brief [Summary of the Czech Public Health Insurance System](https://www.kancelarzp.cz/en/links-info-en/health-insurance-system-in-cz) by the [Health Insurance Bureau](https://www.kancelarzp.cz/en/), an article about [Healthcare in the Czech Republic](https://www.expatarrivals.com/europe/czech-republic/healthcare-czech-republic) by [Expat Arrivals](https://www.expatarrivals.com/) and a [good overview](https://www.euraxess.cz/czech-republic/information-assistance/health-insurance) by Euraxess.

**If you require the urgent care of a doctor**, you can visit ‚Äúpohotovost‚Äù (emergency department) of your local hospital. Some hospitals have separate emergency departments for children and adults. In life threatening situations, call 155 for an ambulance.

**You are expected to register with a nearby General Practitioner (GP)**, ideally close to where you live, soon after your move to Prague. Your GP will be your first point of contact if you fall ill or have any other medical issue ‚Äî unless it‚Äôs an emergency, in which case you should go to one of the hospitals recommended in the following section or call 155 for an ambulance. If you have a specific health issue, your GP will provide you with a written recommendation and point you to a specialised doctor. 

### Some tips when visiting a healthcare provider

Every time you go to the hospital or to any other healthcare provider, **take your health insurance card with you. Check if there is a contract between the healthcare provider and your health insurance company** ‚Äî not all doctors and clinics have contracts with all insurance companies. Health insurance is needed for a visa but many hospitals and health care providers don‚Äôt have contracts with private health insurance companies. See for example [VZP public and private health insurance plans](http://hamiltonhudson.cz/vzp.html). If you have a Czech friend or colleague who is willing to accompany you to the hospital, do not hesitate to ask for their help. **Having a native speaker by your side always comes in handy when dealing with Czech healthcare personnel**. 

**Travel insurance**
If you‚Äôre the holder of a green insurance card, meaning that you are a non-EU citizen (as opposed to blue cards for EU nationals), then you are only insured in the Czech Republic. You will need to organise travel insurance if you will plan on traveling outside of the country. UNIQA is a recommended company, where you can purchase insurance conveniently online (although it seems that the website is only in Czech).
