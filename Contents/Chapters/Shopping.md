## üõç Shopping

### Food

**Supermarkets** and **hypermarkets** are probably the most comfortable choice if you want to buy everything at the same time. All over Prague you will also find **small shops called ‚Äúveƒçerka‚Äù** usually owned and operated by Vietnamese people. Veƒçerkas are open all week, during holidays and weekends and until late evening. You can buy basic groceries, such as bread, fruits and vegetables, rice, pasta, most alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and cigarettes.

You are more likely to find **specialised shops** in older neighbourhoods like Letn√°, Vr≈°ovice, Vinohrady and Sm√≠chov. In housing estates, commonly there is one large supermarket and some veƒçerkas. A few supermarkets are open 24 hours a day, for example [Tesco Eden](https://itesco.cz/prodejny/obchody-tesco/extra-praha-eden/) in Vr≈°ovice.

### Electronics

[Alza](https://www.alza.cz/) is probably the best choice when shopping for electronics. Their sortiment includes computers and computer accessories, mobile phones and home appliances. You can order online and either pick it up at one of their [showrooms](https://www.alza.cz/seznam-prodejen-a-alzaboxu) or have it delivered to your address or to an [Alza box](https://www.alza.cz/seznam-prodejen-a-alzaboxu). [Heureka](https://www.heureka.cz/) is a versatile price comparator tool for buying any products online.

Other options include [Datart](https://www.datart.cz/index.html) (often found in shopping malls) and [Okay](https://www.okay.cz/). In Czech, we call such shops simply ‚Äúelectro‚Äù in case you want to search for it in your neighbourhood. 

### Clothing

Prague is filled with shops and stores. The **biggest shopping center in Prague is [Westfield Chodov](https://cz.westfield.com/chodov)** where you can find fashion shops, parfumeries, pet shops, but also a large food court and a cinema. A popular **outlet shopping center is [Fashion Arena Prague Outlet](https://fashion-arena.cz/)**. Some other shopping centres are [OC Nov√Ω Sm√≠chov](https://novy-smichov.klepierre.cz/), [OC Let≈àany](https://www.oc-letnany.cz/), [Palladium](https://www.palladiumpraha.cz/) or [Centrum ƒåern√Ω Most](https://www.centrumcernymost.cz/). 

**Second hand/vintage shops** are becoming popular in Prague, so if you‚Äôd like to save some money while saving our planet, you will definitely find some in your neighbourhood. The most famous ones are [Prague Thrift Store](https://thriftshop.cz/) (there's one in Holesovice and the other in Vinohrady). There is also a website and mobile app called [Vinted](https://www.vinted.cz/) where you can buy and sell clothing (both brand new and used). 

For online shopping you can browse [Freshlabels](https://www.freshlabels.cz/en/), [ZOOT](https://www.zoot.cz/), [Zalando](https://www.zalando.com/), [ABOUT YOU](https://www.aboutyou.cz/vas-obchod) or [eobuv](https://www.eobuv.cz/). 

### Books

It is very easy and affordable to get a library card (you can also use your L√≠taƒçka) which you can use at libraries all over town ([MLP](https://www.mlp.cz/en/)). The municipal libraries are interconnected so you can order books from one location to another for a small fee (10CZK). They have a good selection of English books.

You can find a section with foreign books in most larger bookstores; the biggest bookstore chains are [NeoLuxor](https://www.luxor.cz/) and [Knihy Dobrovsk√Ω](https://www.knihydobrovsky.cz/). For a selection of only English books visit the [Globe](https://globebookstore.cz/) (Prague‚Äôs first English bookstore that also has a great caf√© and regular English events including quiz nights!), the [Oxford Bookshop](https://www.megabooks.cz/oxford-bookshops) at Korunn√≠, [Budget Books (Levn√© knihy)](https://www.levneknihy.cz/prodejny/praha-1-lazarska-budget-books/) at Lazarsk√° and  [Shakespeare & Sons](https://www.shakes.cz/?lang=en) at Malostransk√°. You can also shop online, for example at [Dobr√© knihy](https://www.dobre-knihy.cz/), and the [Book Depository](https://www.bookdepository.com/) is another great option for purchasing books that deliver to the Czech Republic (sometimes you can get free delivery deals).

Hardware stores and hobby markets

Original hardware stores, or ‚Äú≈æelez√°≈ôstv√≠‚Äù in Czech, are becoming less common in Prague. A few examples are [U Rotta](https://www.urotta.cz/) (Prague 1), [≈Ωelez√°≈ôstv√≠ Sko≈ôepa a syn](https://www.zelezarstvizizkov.cz/) (Prague 3) or [≈Ωelez√°≈ôstv√≠ na Podbabsk√©](http://zelezarstvinapodbabske.cz/) (Prague 6). If you want to buy some tools, paint, or any other hardware for your household or garden, this is where you find it. 

You can also visit some of the Hobby markets, such as [Bauhaus](https://www.bauhaus.cz/), [OBI](https://www.obi.cz/), [Baumax](https://www.baumax.cz/) or [Hornbach](https://www.hornbach.cz/). You will likely find almost everything you need as these are huge stores. Their size is also a disadvantage, because they are not situated anywhere near the city center. The most accessible one by public transport is Bauhaus Pankr√°c, right next to the metro station Pankr√°c.
