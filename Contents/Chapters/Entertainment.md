Gardens and parks

Some of the most popular parks in Prague are Pet≈ô√≠n, Stromovka, Letensk√© sady, Gr√©bovka (Havl√≠ƒçkovy sady), Riegrovy sady (colloquially called ‚ÄúRiegr√°ƒçe‚Äù) and Centr√°ln√≠ park Pankr√°c. There are a number of smaller parks in almost every neighbourhood. Letn√° and Riegr√°ƒçe are homes to the 2 most popular beer gardens in Prague that boast a beautiful view of the city (highly recommended at sunset!).

The Zoological garden in Prague has been voted the 7th most beautiful in the world by TripAdvisor and is well worth a visit. Prague also has two botanical gardens, one in Tr√≥ja, next to the ZOO and one in the city center near Karlovo n√°mƒõst√≠. 

Hiking and trips

If you need inspiration on what to do or where to go, the website Kudy z nudy (only in Czech) is a great source for tips. And you don‚Äôt have to stay in Prague ‚Äî the entire Czech Republic is dotted with places worth exploring, from castles and chateaus to natural parks. 

Linked are a few good sources for tips for weekend trips and 10 day trip destinations by Expats.cz and also Day and weekend trips by Czech Tourism. 

Mapy.cz is a useful tool, as it provides a map of the dense network of hiking trails in the Czech Republic.

Facebook groups such as Discovering Prague & CZ Group, Prague Hikes, Trips, Friends & more and Hiking around Prague can help you meet fellow hiking enthusiasts. Don‚Äôt forget to also check your local embassy as some are quite active within their local community. 

A few recommendations from our interviewees

Only 3 hours away from Prague you will find the small but incredibly picturesque town of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov. It takes only about 10 minutes to walk from the main square to the castle, so it‚Äôs perfect for a day-trip or a small weekend getaway. 

Visiting ƒåesk√© ≈†v√Ωcarsko, one of the four national parks of the Czech Republic, is an absolute must if you enjoy hiking, walking and the outdoors. The scenery is filled with massive rock towers, gates, walls and mazes and is reminiscent of a backdrop to an Avatar movie. Explore this handy guide for planning your routes, and definitely make sure to pay a visit to the Pravƒçick√° Gate, a massive rock formation and the largest sandstone rock gate in Europe that has become the symbol of the park and is also a national natural monument.

The Czechs love to spend their summers canoeing, rafting or kayaking down rivers with friends and family. The S√°zava river is popular among beginners and recreational canoeists as it runs quite smoothly through deep forests, sunny meadows, rocky slopes and both natural and historical monuments, showcasing some of the best that Czech lands have to offer. The cost of a canoe for two persons is around 400kƒç/day and you can decide on the length of the trip yourself ‚Äì some prefer a day trip while others like to spend an entire week, camping on the river bank or staying in nearby hotels (the website for planning trips is only in Czech).

For those who enjoy being on the water, the Cere Yacht Club organises sailing weekend courses. Check beforehand if the instructions could be provided in English.

With the arrival of autumn, you will find many Czechs in their natural habitat ‚Äì foraging in forests with wicker baskets searching for mushrooms. Mushroom-picking has a long history in the Bohemian region and Czechs take it very seriously! It‚Äôs also a super fun outdoor activity and a great opportunity to explore new sceneries. Although you‚Äôll find some mushrooms growing in Prague, for example in the ≈†√°rka Valley or Kl√°novice forests, it‚Äôs definitely worth traveling a bit to get the most out of the experience. If you‚Äôre new to this, it‚Äôs crucial to do some research and preparation beforehand, so read about what mushrooms are safe to eat, what tools to bring with you and which areas are most abundant.

If you‚Äôre looking for a winter outdoor activity as well as a challenge, you can try the longest natural ice-skating trail in the world on the frozen Lipno lake (in South Bohemia, close to ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov). It‚Äôs about a 4 hour train ride from Prague, but you can skate for free and the surrounding landscapes are truly breathtaking.
