### Post office

If you‚Äôd like to send a postcard, a letter or a parcel, you go to the ‚Äúpo≈°ta‚Äù (post office in Czech) which you will find in every neighbourhood. Post offices are generally open between 8 am and 6 pm on weekdays and on Saturday mornings from 10 until 12, and generally closed on Sundays and during holidays. **The main post office in Prague, at [Jind≈ôi≈°sk√° 14](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/3533/czech-post-main-post-office-ceska-posta-hlavni-posta?back=1)**, is open from 2 a.m. until midnight seven days a week. Here is the [official website of Czech post](https://www.ceskaposta.cz/en/index), where you can find all the addresses and detailed information about the services.  

More useful information on how to navigate Czech post offices and their services can be found in [this article](https://news.expats.cz/prague-relocation/czech-post-office/). 

### Laundry

In the Czech Republic, it‚Äôs common to have your own washing machine in your apartment. Alternatively, you can visit for example [Andy‚Äôs Laundromat](https://praguelaundromat.cz/en/) or [Speed Queen](https://www.vyperete.cz/en/).  

For dry cleaning options in the city center see for example [Dry Cleaning Daja](https://www.cistirna-odevu-daja.cz/en/) or [Pure Clean](https://cistirnapureclean.cz/#).

### Repair services

If something breaks in your apartment, you‚Äôll want to look for an oprav√°≈ô/repairman. It might be best to ask your Czech colleagues or friends for a recommendation. Alternatively, [Oprav√°rna](https://www.opravarna.cz/) is a database of all repair shops, repairmen and services. There is also a term called ‚Äúhodinov√Ω man≈æel‚Äù in Czech, which means ‚Äúa husband for an hour‚Äù in translation. A hodinov√Ω man≈æel is usually a handyman or repairman. There is a website called [Vy≈ôe≈° mi to](https://www.vyresmito.cz/), which matches a request for a repair with a handyman.

Prague has a variety of shoe and clothing repair and alteration shops, see for example [Lamarche](https://www.lamarche.cz/) in Prague 1 or [Krejcovstvi](http://www.krejcovstvi.info/en/) in Prague 5.
