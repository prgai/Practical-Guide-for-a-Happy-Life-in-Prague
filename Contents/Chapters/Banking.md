### Opening a bank account in the Czech Republic

Opening a bank account in the Czech Republic should be possible for all nationalities. Always take with you at least two forms of identification, we would recommend an ID or a passport and your visa or residence permit. Some banks also require some sort of proof of your connection to the Czech Republic ‚Äî for example your employment contract, lease agreement or residence permit. 

Dealing with banks may be more difficult for non-EU citizens (this is especially the case for countries such as Syria, Iran, or Libya). The bank will always evaluate your application on an individual basis. In practice, this can mean that they might ask more questions and require more documents.

**We highly recommend calling the chosen bank in advance of your visit. You can contact the helpdesk or the specific branch directly and schedule an appointment with a person who speaks English.**
