## üçæ Food and beverage

### Czech cuisine

[Czech cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_cuisine) is largely meat-based and definitely not a synonym for healthy cooking (classic dishes tend to be high in calories, fat and sugar). But as with all things, we encourage you to indulge in moderation and try the variety of tasty dishes that the cuisine has to offer. Below is a list of typical Czech dishes:

### Soups
- Potato soup (bramboraƒçka)
- Garlic soup (ƒçesneƒçka)
- Dill soup with potatoes and mushrooms (kulajda)
- Cabbage soup (zel≈àaƒçka)

### Main dishes
- Beef sirloin with vegetable cream sauce and dumplings (sv√≠ƒçkov√°)
- Roasted duck with red sauerkraut and dumplings (kachna se zelim)
- Dill sauce with poached egg or beef (koprovka)
- Fried cheese with potatoes and tartar sauce (sma≈æ√°k s bramborem a tatarkou)
- Beef goulash with dumplings (gul√°≈°)
- Roasted pork with sauerkraut and dumplings (knedlo-vep≈ôo-zelo)

### Desserts and sweet main dishes
- Fruit dumplings ‚Äî usually filled with either strawberries, blueberries, apricots or plums (ovocn√© knedl√≠ky)
- Sweet yeast dough buns called ‚Äúbuchty‚Äù (usually filled with either poppy seeds, curd cheese or plum jam)
- ‚ÄúKol√°ƒçe‚Äù made from a similar dough as ‚Äúbuchty,‚Äù with similar fillings but in different round shapes
- Sponge cake with fruits called ‚Äúbublanina‚Äù
- Pancakes

Norbert Strahov](https://www.klasterni-pivovar.cz/). 

### Czech beer

According to Wikipedia, the [Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_the_Czech_Republic). There is no denying that beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage amongst the Czechs. If this interests you, have a look at this article about the [history of beer in the Czech Republic](https://www.prague.eu/en/articles/history-of-czech-beer-10522), otherwise we definitely recommend going to your local pub and tasting it for yourself (although chances are you already did). :-)

The largest Czech beer breweries are Pilsner Urquell (Plze≈àsk√Ω prazdroj, the world's first pilsner, Gambrinus, Velkopopovick√Ω Kozel, Radegast), Staropramen (Staropramen, Ostravar, Bran√≠k and Velvet) and Budweiser Budvar. Other popular brands include Kru≈°ovice, Starobrno, B≈ôez≈à√°k, Zlatopramen, Lobkowicz, Bernard and Svijany. Smaller Czech breweries have become increasingly popular in the last few years.

### Eating out

In many restaurants, you can find special affordable lunch menus during lunch times (offered usually between 11am and 2pm) that include soup and a main course. You can also eat at a menza (university canteen) for students and university employees. 

Tips are not usually included in the final price and it‚Äôs common to tip your waiter/waitress around 10‚Äì15% if you are happy with their service. Most places take credit/debit cards and prefer tips to be paid by cash.

A part of your salary can sometimes be paid in ‚Äústravenky‚Äù; meal vouchers for buying food in the supermarket or for paying in a restaurant. 

Especially in recent years, Prague has become popular amongst foodies with many new bistros, cafes and restaurants priding themselves in excellent Czech and international cuisine. For recommendations, it‚Äôs useful to refer to [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g274707-Prague_Bohemia.html) reviews or follow bloggers such as the Taste of Prague (their [website](https://www.tasteofprague.com/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tasteofprague/) are full of great tips). 

### Eating out with dietary restrictions

Czech restaurants are obliged to provide information about allergens in every meal using a [standardised list of allergens](https://blog.foreigners.cz/standardized-allergy-charts-in-prague/). If you‚Äôre allergic to something, inform the waiter/waitress as you order.

To be a vegan or vegetarian in Prague is quite easy. There are a number of vegan and vegetarian restaurants and shops where you can buy vegan products. Apart from special shops called ‚ÄúZdrav√° v√Ω≈æiva‚Äù (Healthy Food), vegan products are also available in large supermarkets like [Tesco](https://nakup.itesco.cz/groceries/en-GB/) and [Albert](https://www.albert.cz/), and possibly the best selection is in [Globus](https://www.globus.cz/). You can also buy vegan products via online supermarkets [Rohl√≠k](https://www.rohlik.cz/en/) and [Ko≈°√≠k](https://www.kosik.cz/). Some of the best vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Prague are: [Maitrea](https://www.restaurace-maitrea.cz/), [Sandokan vegan bistro](https://sandokanprague.cz/), [Forky‚Äôs](https://www.forkys.eu/), [Eaternia](https://www.facebook.com/eaterniajidelna/), [Vegan‚Äôs Prague](http://www.vegansprague.cz/?EN), [Pastva](https://www.pastva-restaurant.cz/) and [Estrella](https://estrellarestaurant.cz/).

There are no dedicated gluten free restaurants in Prague but most places offer some kind of gluten free meal. Gluten free products are also available in Zdrav√° v√Ω≈æiva shops and all the big supermarkets (regular and online).
