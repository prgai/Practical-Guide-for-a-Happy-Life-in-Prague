### Maternity leave and paid parental leave

If you are planning a family, [this article by Euraxess](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/) offers basic information about [maternity leave and paid parental leave](https://www.euraxess.cz/czech-republic/information-assistance/childrenfamily-and-personal-life/maternity-leave-and-parental) in the Czech Republic. For a more detailed overview, see the section [Czech Republic - Child benefits](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1106&langId=en&intPageId=4469) on the [European Commission website](https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en).

A summary of the most important points from the article by [Euraxess](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/):

- ‚ÄúPenƒõ≈æit√° pomoc v mate≈ôstv√≠‚Äù ‚Äî a benefit more commonly known as mate≈ôsk√° (maternity leave) is **financial support in place of a parent's salary and is paid for 28 weeks** (or for twins, triplets, etc. 37 weeks).
- The maternity leave period begins at least **six and at most eight weeks before the baby is due** to be born.
- Maternity leave amounts to **70% of your average gross salary**, calculated based on the preceding year; for the self-employed the amount is established based on the level of sickness insurance contributions paid.
- When the baby is 7 weeks, the **father can take over paternity leave** in place of the mother (if he is eligible, based on the same conditions ‚Äî sickness insurance).
- **Paid parental leave** is financial support for parents which usually continues after the end of maternity leave. You are eligible if you care for your child at home (as opposed to taking him/her to a daycare/nursery/pre-school).
- Paid parental leave consists of a benefit of a **maximum of 300,000 CZK**, which must be taken during the first four years of the child's life.
If either parent had participated in sickness insurance prior to taking parental leave, you can choose the rate at which you take it. The maximum amount is 70% of 30x your "denn√≠ vymƒõ≈ôovac√≠ z√°klad" (the average daily salary used to calculate maternity leave pay) on the day the child was born, but cannot be higher than 40,068 CZK and lower than 50 CZK per month. This is especially convenient for those with higher incomes who want to return to work sooner. In the case of multiples, the amount is the maximum monthly amount multiplied by 1.5 (so 60,102 CZK). It‚Äôs possible to change the rate once every three months.
- If neither parent paid sickness insurance before the child was born, you must take the parental leave at the slowest rate ‚Äî meaning you will receive it monthly until the child's fourth birthday at a rate of 7,600 CZK per month until he/she is 9 months old, and 3,800 CZK per month thereafter.

### Nursery

Czech Republic has a chronic lack of capacity in nurseries. Until 2014 nurseries were some sort of medical institution operated by actual nurses, but since then their status is no longer determined by law. Many nurseries were closed then because the demand was low, but now the situation is now different. Since 2014 all nurseries are private or municipal and there is a huge demand but the capacity is very limited. **Nurseries are usually for babies from 6 months/1 year old until 3 years old**. Price per month for private nurseries usually  starts at around 7,000 CZK. 

Do check with your institution as some may have their own nursery on-site.

### Kindergarten

Same as nurseries, kindergartens in general also lack capacity. There are both private and public kindergartens. **It‚Äôs compulsory to send your child to kindergarten 1 year prior to enrolling in primary school** (usually at the age of 6). Kindergartens are usually for children from 3 until 6 years old. 

**In state kindergartens**, the principal defines any [further requirements and the admission criteria](https://icpraha.com/en/czech-kindergartens-and-elementary-schools/) (e.g. older kids, those living in the catchment area, children with both parents working, those going to attend full day, etc. get priority). For example, a kindergarten located in Prague 3 will favour a child who lives in Prague 3, and in some specific cases there are also specific catchment area streets ‚Äì as for example in Prague 5. It‚Äôs also an advantage if there is already a sibling attending the same kindergarten. Fees are usually around 1000CZK/month (school fees can be reclaimed in your annual tax return; in 2020 the maximum was [14,500CZK per year](https://www.du.cz/33/sleva-za-umisteni-ditete-tzv-skolkovne-uniqueidmRRWSbk196FNf8-jVUh4ElbwbxjXlw96fxSwjiN5xfpcHOzpxaO3Sg/)) and lunches cost around 800-900CZK/month. There are commonly around 20-25 children in every group, however admission can sometimes be difficult due to the aforementioned issue with capacities. 

Admission into **private kindergartens** can be easier, however fees are considerably higher and can start at 15,000‚Äì20,000 CZK/month. On the other hand, there are many types to choose from ‚Äî Montessori, Waldorf, bilingual, outdoor and other alternative options. There are usually more teachers available, so they can dedicate more time to each child individually.

Alternatives to nurseries and kindergartens are ‚Äú**dƒõtsk√© skupiny**‚Äù (groups of children in translation), which are private institutions for children from 1 year of age. You may also opt **‚Äòjesle‚Äô**, which are facilities for younger children, or **babysitting/nanny services** ‚Äì either through agencies or independent services. More info can be found in [this useful summary](https://www.easyexpat.com/en/guides/czech-republic/prague/practical/babysitting.htm). A popular platform for finding independent babysitters is [Hl√≠daƒçky.cz](https://www.hlidacky.cz/en) (where you can also find home cleaning, pet care and senior care).
