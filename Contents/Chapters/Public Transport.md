## üöÄ Public Transport

If you ask us, Prague has one of the best public transportation systems in Europe. It‚Äôs easy to use, usually on time and it covers the majority of the city and its outskirts. It is an integrated public transportation system, meaning that one ticket can be used for the bus, metro, tram, a number of ferries and the Pet≈ô√≠n cable car as long as you travel within the time limit of your ticket. 

### Fares

You can buy a **one-time ticket** in the ticket machine (in every metro station and some of the highly frequented tram or bus stations), directly from the bus driver (although we don‚Äôt really recommend it because drivers often don‚Äôt speak English and prefer not to be disturbed), in newspaper shops or inside some newer trams using contactless credit or debit cards. You can also buy a ticket via text message; the price of the 90 min. ticket is 32 CZK and the text message format is ‚ÄúDPT32‚Äù sent to 90206. Take a look at the [fare price list](https://www.dpp.cz/en/fares/fare-pricelist#1-1) for detailed information. **Don‚Äôt forget to validate your ticket by stamping it in the yellow ticket validator!**

You can also purchase a **long-term coupon** which you can buy monthly (550 CZK), quarterly (1480 CZK), for 5 months (2450 CZK) or annually (3650 CZK). The annual coupon is your best choice if you are going to spend a year in Prague and you have to commute to work daily. For long-term coupons you can purchase [the L√≠taƒçka card](https://www.pidlitacka.cz/home) (your coupon will be loaded on the card) which you can also use as a library card in the [Municipal Library of Prague](https://www.mlp.cz/en/) or you can purchase a paper coupon in any of the public transport offices.. You can get all information in English on the [PID L√≠taƒçka website](https://www.pidlitacka.cz/home). 

### Means of public transport

- The **Prague [metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Metro)** has three lines (A = green line, B = yellow line and C = red line) and it‚Äôs the fastest way to travel through the city. The metro operates daily from 5 am until midnight with 2-3 min. intervals during the day and 4-10 min. during weekends, holidays and evenings.
- If you don‚Äôt like to travel underground, you can always use a **[tram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trams_in_Prague)**. Trams operate daily from 4:30 am until midnight. There are also night trams that operate in 30 min. intervals. **Important warning: trams always have the right of way at pedestrian crossings!** 
- The daytime and nighttime service of **[buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buses_in_Prague)** is the same as trams. When you are travelling outside of Prague with a bus number higher than 300 (suburban transport), always use the front door to enter. You will probably have to buy a ticket or pay an additional fare even if you have a L√≠taƒçka. In the [fare price list](https://www.dpp.cz/en/fares/fare-pricelist#2-6) mentioned above, you will find further information. 
- The **[funicular](https://www.dpp.cz/en/entertainment-and-experience/events-and-attractions/funicular-to-petrin)** runs from √öjezd to the top of Pet≈ô√≠n hill, with a stop halfway at Neboz√≠zek. Time intervals are different throughout the year. 
- **[Ferries](https://pid.cz/en/ferries/)** are quite a useful and pleasant means of shortening your commute if you need to cross the river. Some of them operate throughout the whole year, some of them only from April to October. 

### Ticket inspection

The validity of tickets can be checked by ticket inspectors of the Dopravn√≠ podnik hl. mƒõsta Prahy (DPP ‚Äî the Prague Public Transit Company) at any time during your commute. Ticket inspectors are usually quite hard to spot as they don‚Äôt wear any kind of uniform, nevertheless they are always obliged to show you their badge and to issue a receipt if you pay a fine. A fine for not having a valid ticket is 800 CZK (if paid on the spot or on the 15th calendar day from the inspection date at the latest) or 1500 CZK if paid later (via transfer or at the [additional payments counter](https://www.dpp.cz/en/fares/penalties-transport-inspectors/additional-payments-counter)). If you happen to forget your L√≠taƒçka at home and you get inspected, you can ask for the fine ticket to pay later instead of paying on the spot, and you can take it to the additional payments counter and dispute it when you show a valid L√≠taƒçka. 

### Public transport mobile phone apps

- [PID L√≠taƒçka](https://app.pidlitacka.cz/en/) is useful if you have the L√≠taƒçka card, so you don‚Äôt have to carry it with you all the time; the coupon will be loaded onto the app in your phone and in case the coupon is no longer valid, you can purchase a new one in the interface or just buy a ticket instead.
- [IDOS](http://idos.idnes.cz/) and [CG Transit](https://www.circlegate.com/) are tools for finding connections, not just for public transport but also for trains and buses across the whole country.

### Trains

Travelling by train is very common, both throughout the Czech Republic and across Prague. Other than the [Prague main train station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praha_hlavn%C3%AD_n%C3%A1dra%C5%BE%C3%AD), there are a number of smaller train stations directly in the city or in suburban areas. Examples of bigger ones are [Sm√≠chovsk√© n√°dra≈æ√≠](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praha-Sm%C3%ADchov_(n%C3%A1dra%C5%BE%C3%AD)) in Prague 5, [Masarykovo n√°dra≈æ√≠](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praha_Masarykovo_n%C3%A1dra%C5%BE%C3%AD) in the city centre or [N√°dra≈æ√≠ Vr≈°ovice](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praha-Vr%C5%A1ovice_(n%C3%A1dra%C5%BE%C3%AD)) in Prague 10. You can use your [L√≠taƒçka](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iPcpxQ0UPT92rINIKPU8-HMLCKl9xzAvxFvXTdWnFMU/edit#heading=h.m4jgswh8hggr) card but you need to buy additional tickets when traveling beyond Prague.

To find a train connection, you can also use the [CG Transit app](https://www.circlegate.com/) or the [IDOS](http://idos.idnes.cz/) app or website. You can purchase tickets on the website of [ƒåesk√© dr√°hy](https://www.cd.cz/en/default.htm) (Czech Railways).

In addition to the public Czech Railways company (ƒåD), two more companies provide train connections at a similar standard of price and quality: [Regiojet](http://www.regiojet.cz) and [Leo Express](http://www.leoexpress.com/en).

### Traveling by bus within CZ and Europe

Yellow RegioJet buses (formerly Student Agency) are popular for traveling within Czech Republic and Europe, although [not necessarily the cheapest](https://jizdenky.regiojet.cz/?0). Other options include [Flixbus](https://global.flixbus.com/bus-routes) and [Tourbus](http://www.tourbus.cz). 

### Driving in Prague

In the article [Driving in the Czech Republic](https://blog.foreigners.cz/driving-in-the-czech-republic/) you will find detailed information on driving in Prague. If you are considering getting a driver‚Äôs licence, [this article](https://blog.foreigners.cz/how-to-get-a-driving-licence-in-the-czech-republic/) may also be useful.

Drivers in Prague are often impatient and they tend to drive fast ‚Äî in such cases, play it safe and don‚Äôt follow their lead. If you make a mistake or you hesitate, someone may honk at you, but again, don‚Äôt get phased by this! :-)

The website [Parkuj v klidu](https://www.parkujvklidu.cz/english/homepage/) will help you with orientation between parking zones.

### Some basic dos and don‚Äôts:

- Drive on the right side.
- Have a [valid driver's license](https://irsczech.com/en/driving-license-for-foreigners-in-the-czech-republic), a car license (technick√Ω pr≈Økaz)  and the ‚ÄòZelena karta‚Äô (proof of third party car insurance) on you at all times.
- Motor vehicles must have their lights on at all times, day and night.
- It‚Äôs forbidden to hold or otherwise use your mobile phone without the use of a hands free kit while driving.
- Unlike in many European countries, Czech Republic has a zero tolerance for drinking and driving.
- It‚Äôs mandatory to wear a seatbelt for the driver and all passengers.
- The speed limit in urban areas is 50 km/h, outside of town it‚Äôs 90 km/h, on motorways it‚Äôs 110 km/h and on highways 130 km/hour.
- Speed cameras and radars monitor the speed of vehicles on many roads ‚Äî mind the limit! :-)
- To access a Czech highway, you must buy a sticker called ‚Äú[d√°lniƒçn√≠ zn√°mka](http://www.motorway.cz/stickers)‚Äù (a form of a highway tax). From 2021, you can purchase it in [electronic form](https://edalnice.cz/en/index.html#/validation).

### Cycling in Prague

Riding a bicycle is becoming increasingly popular in Prague, although it‚Äôs definitely not Amsterdam nor Denmark, so be careful when cycling in traffic as not all Czech drivers are quite used to cyclists yet. Take a look at the [General tips for safe cycling in traffic](https://prahounakole.cz/en/general-tips-safe-cycling-traffic/) provided by the online magazine [Prahou na kole](https://prahounakole.cz/en/prague-cycle-route-system/) (Through Prague By Bike), which is also a great source of information on various cycling routes in Prague. There are many examples of comfortable and scenic routes that you can enjoy, especially some of the ones running [along the river](https://www.komoot.com/smarttour/791995) and the map service [Mapy.cz](http://www.mapy.cz) is great for finding more. If you‚Äôre interested, the initiative [Do pr√°ce na kole](https://www.dopracenakole.cz/en) (To Work By Bike) organises challenges to encourage people to bike to work and you can even win prizes.

If you don‚Äôt want to purchase your own, you can use the bike sharing service [Rekola](https://www.rekola.cz/en/).

### Taxi 

Unfortunately, Prague is rather infamous for its taxi service. There is a brief summary for [taking a taxi in the Czech Republic](http://www.myczechrepublic.com/prague/prague_taxi.html) on the website [My Czech Republic](http://www.myczechrepublic.com/) and also [a great article](https://www.praguego.com/transport/taxi/) on the website [PragueGO](https://www.praguego.com/). 

Unless absolutely necessary, we don‚Äôt recommend taking a taxi on the street. You can use apps on your phone from international companies like [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cz/en/) or [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en/) or use local services such as [Liftago](https://www.liftago.com/), [Modr√Ω Andƒõl](https://www.modryandel.cz/pro-klienty) or [Taxi Praha/Nejlevnƒõj≈°√≠ taxi](https://www.taxi-praha.cz/). If you do take a taxi on the street, your best bet is [AAA taxi](http://www.aaataxi.cz/en/home/) as one of the largest taxi companies in Prague which can also be most commonly seen at the Prague airport and at the busiest tourist destinations. **When taking a taxi on the street, make sure it is a legitimate, registered taxi** ‚Äî the yellow roof lamp must be permanently installed and must read TAXI in black letters on both sides. The driver's name, license number and rates (28 CZK/km is considered the maximum fare) should be printed on both front doors.
