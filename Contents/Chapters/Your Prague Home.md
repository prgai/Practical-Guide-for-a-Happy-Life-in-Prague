Your Prague home

Furniture

Let’s assume you already have accommodation. Well, now you need some furniture.

IKEA is a good choice if you don’t want to spend a fortune. There are two stores in Prague: Zličín and Černý Most — both located conveniently on the metro line.
JYSK is an equally good option for affordable furniture and home decor.
If you are looking for something more stylish, visit the online store Bonami.
Heureka is the largest Czech online shopping portal and price comparator which can also come in handy when searching (not only) for furniture. 
You may also want to look for second hand furniture (and other items) on Facebook groups such as Prague - Buy Sell Trade - OFFICIAL GROUP or Prague Buy/Sell/Trade by Expats.cz and online thrift stores Bazos and Sbazar.

Electricity and gas

You can find detailed information in this article by Easy expat. The most common providers for Prague are PRE and Pražská plynárenská (Prague Gas).

Payments for electricity and gas may be included in your rental agreement, in which case the landlord will be taking care of it. If not, you will have to register in your name before you move in. Always ask about the payment method and fee before signing the rental agreement. 

When registering electricity or gas in your name, you will have to personally visit the PRE customer center (electricity) or the Prague Gas customer center in Prague 1 or Prague 4, bringing with you proof of identity (identity card or passport). If you are a non-EU or non-EEA citizen, you will need a lease agreement or a property ownership document to conclude an agreement and the presence of a guarantor (citizen of the Czech Republic) or his/her declaration certified by a notary. You can always call in advance and schedule a meeting with a person who speaks English.

Both PRE and Prague Gas now offer the option to provide both gas and electricity, which may be more convenient.

Electricity in Prague is 230V, 50Hz AC. Outlets have the standard European socket with two small round holes and a protruding earth (ground) pin, and the power plug is type E.

Internet connection

The largest internet providers in the Czech Republic are UPC and O2. Both companies also provide mobile phone services (UPC and Vodafone are the same company). There are also smaller companies providing internet connection for Prague only, such as Airwaynet. Ask your landlord about internet when signing your rental agreement. Buildings usually have their own providers, so the installment process is easier. 

Waste collection

You will find black municipal solid waste bins located on the street or sometimes on the ground floor of your building. Recycling bins for sorted waste are usually located next to each other — yellow for plastic, blue for paper, white for white glass and green for coloured glass. In some places you can also find grey bins for metal and orange/black bins for beverage cartons, see this map of waste bins in Prague. You can find useful information about recycling on jaktridit.cz.

For clothing that you no longer want to wear or any other textile, there are designated orange bins. Here is a map of where you can find them. Some places also have small electrical recycling bins.

TV and radio license

Note that you are obliged to pay the TV and radio license if you have a television and a radio. If you do not, you need to fill in a document declaring that you don’t use the services and can therefore waive these fees.
