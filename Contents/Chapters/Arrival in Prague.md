For detailed information about visa and residence permits, see section [Visa and residence permit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iPcpxQ0UPT92rINIKPU8-HMLCKl9xzAvxFvXTdWnFMU/edit#heading=h.hsgq6278i930).

[Euraxess](https://www.euraxess.cz/information/search/field_service_category/living-europe-1221/country/czech-republic-1058) is a great source and point of contact as their main mission is to help researchers who are moving to and out of the Czech Republic. Chances are you‚Äôve already been in contact with them if you‚Äôve been applying for a visa as a non-EU citizen.

- If you are **a citizen of the EU, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland** and you are planning to stay in the Czech Republic for more than 3 months, you need to apply for a <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21672749&doctype=ART">temporary residence</a>. Keep in mind that you will need proof of accommodation.
- If you are a citizen of a third country*, you need to apply for a [short-term](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21672767&doctype=ART) or [long-term](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21673057&doctype=ART) visa or for [long-term residence](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21673122&doctype=ART).
  * *Non-EU nationals are citizens of countries neither members of the EU, nor citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, nor their family members; the term used in legislation for this group is third country nationals.
- Find accommodation.
- Optional but highly recommended: Find a Czech language course if it‚Äôs not provided by your employer.
- If you plan on arriving to Prague by plane, see how to get from the airport to the metro line.


### Accommodation

#### Where to look?

[Bezrealitky](https://www.bezrealitky.com/) advertises apartments for rent directly by owners so you can avoid agency commission fees. The downside is that many renters don‚Äôt reply to queries in English. The cost of the service is 99 CZK or EUR 3.5 per 3 months for a Basic account and 299 Kƒç/EUR 11 per 3 months for a Premium account. 

Sreality offers apartments for rent by owners or more frequently by real estate agencies whose agents are more likely to speak English and respond promptly. The deposit is usually 1 month's rent.

There are also several Facebook groups. Below are a few examples, however it may be useful to search and ask around for more:
- [Praha - Bydlen√≠ v Praze, Spolubydlen√≠, n√°jem, pron√°jem, podn√°jem, byt, d≈Øm](https://www.facebook.com/groups/126198231421193/)
- [FLATSHARE in PRAGUE](https://www.facebook.com/groups/524182954269921/)
- [Prague Rent a room/house/apartment/flat/accommodation/Long/short-term](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PragueRoom/)
- [Apartments for Rent in Prague](https://www.facebook.com/groups/apartmentsinprague/)

Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask your Prague colleagues and friends if they know about any available accommodation. From the experience of our interviewees, it‚Äôs quite common that you may find a room or apartment through word-of-mouth.

While you look for something permanent, you may want to opt for staying in a hotel, [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) or an apartment through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com). The Czech Academy of Sciences (AVCR) offers [Hotel Mazanka](http://www.hotel-mazanka.cz/index.html) to their international staff.

Some institutions also own their own short-term accommodation facilities. For example, Charles University has some studios for rent in Jinonice and the Institute of Computer Science of the Academy of Sciences has two studios near L√°dv√≠. Check with your institution and see what options are available.

[The blog section](https://blog.foreigners.cz/) of [Foreigners.cz](https://www.foreigners.cz/) provides some [useful tips on lease agreements](https://blog.foreigners.cz/czech-lease-agreement/) and [Euraxess provides some useful notes on renting](https://www.euraxess.cz/czech-republic/information-assistance/accommodation/renting).

#### A few tips for understanding the ads

In the Czech Republic, apartments are often classified according to ‚Äúdispositions‚Äù, for example **1+kk** or **2+1**. Rather than describing the size of the apartment, this tells us how many rooms the apartment has and whether the kitchen is a separate room or a kitchenette. **The first number indicates the number of rooms** in the apartment of at least 8m2 (it does not tell us the type of the room, so it can be a bedroom, living room or dining room), **while the second number or label refers to either a separate kitchen (+1) or a kitchenette/corner kitchen (+kk)**. So, whereas 2+1 indicates two rooms and a separate kitchen, 2+kk indicates two rooms, one of which features a kitchenette. **A so-called ‚Äògarsonka‚Äô is an apartment studio** very similar to 1+kk, the main difference being that in the latter, the kitchenette should be somehow separated from the rest of the room (e.g. with a bar).

### Districts of Prague

Prague is divided into 10 municipal districts (1‚Äì10), 22 administrative districts (1‚Äì22), 57 municipal parts and 112 cadastral areas. For further information see [Districts of Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Prague) on Wikipedia.

Below is a brief overview of the different popular neighbourhoods organised according to the cost of rent. Have a look at [Guide to Prague‚Äôs Neighborhoods](https://passionpassport.com/prague-neighborhood-guide/) and [Where to Live in Prague?](https://blog.foreigners.cz/where-to-live-in-prague/) for more detailed information. 

Generally, the closer you get to the city center, the higher the rent. But that does not mean that you have to forget about living in popular districts like Letn√°, Vinohrady or Dejvice. The cost of rent very much depends on the apartment size, its location in the building (one generally pays for a view) or if it has recently been renovated.

#### Upscale

[Letn√°](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-complete-guide-to-life-at-letna/unh/) is part of the [Hole≈°ovice](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-industrial-ethos-of-soon-to-be-hip-holesovice/hnh/) district. Home to Prague‚Äôs hipster community, artists and intellectuals, it‚Äôs surrounded by two beautiful parks, [Letensk√© sady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letn%C3%A1_Park) and [Stromovka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromovka), and is abounding with restaurants, bars, caf√©s and small shops. You can easily take a tram or walk to the city center. Rent in Letn√° is usually expensive, but it can be a good place to flatshare.

[Vinohrady](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-insurmountable-coolness-of-upper-vinohrady/dfg/) is one of the most popular expat districts located near the [Riegrovy sady](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/508/rieger-gardens-riegrovy-sady) (Rieger Gardens) and a great variety of restaurants, bars, pubs, caf√©s and shops. The area around [Ji≈ô√≠ho z Podƒõbrad square](https://www.prague-stay.com/lifestyle/review/1604-jiriho-z-podebrad-square), known for its large [farmer‚Äôs market](https://trhyjirak.cz/), is where you can find the most foreigners. Same as in Letn√°, one pays a premium for beauty and a convenient location close to the centre.

[Karl√≠n](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-two-faced-miracle-of-karlin/umh/), previously home to the socially disadvantaged, and literally washed out by the [floods in 2002](https://livingprague.com/prague-history/prague-flood/), has undergone a true transformation. It‚Äôs now filled with modern office and residential buildings and hip cafes, restaurants and shops and the [Karl√≠n Barracks](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/3398/karlin-barracks). It has become one of the most important business districts which naturally translates into higher costs of living.

[Dejvice](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-inseparable-dance-of-dejvices-highs-and-lows/agg/) is located close to the Prague Castle and along with [Bubeneƒç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubene%C4%8D), it is home to most embassies situated in beautiful villas built during the [First Republic](http://www.myczechrepublic.com/czech-history/first-republic.html). It‚Äôs a pleasant and calm neighbourhood, often sought after by families and with the vast Stromovka park conveniently nearby ‚Äî and hence it‚Äôs on the pricier side.


#### The golden mean

[≈Ωi≈ækov](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-irrevocable-genius-loci-of-zizkovs-main-street/yph/), the cheaper and grittier neighbour of Vinohrady, is very popular among young people and students; not only because it is a fun place for a night out, but also because of the [Paruk√°≈ôka](https://www.parukarka.cz/park-parukarka-praha3.php) and [V√≠tkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Monument_at_V%C3%ADtkov) parks, a relatively central location and reasonable costs of living. 

[Sm√≠chov](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-ingenious-anarchy-of-nightlife-in-smichov/slh/) is a mix of residential and office buildings, restaurants and small shops as well as [one of Prague‚Äôs major shopping centers](https://novy-smichov.klepierre.cz/#). Rent prices are relatively moderate and you can easily get to the city center by metro and tram. There are also a few nice parks and the [river bank](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/2071/smichovska-naplavka-embankment-horejsi-nabrezi) is perfect for walks.

[Vr≈°ovice](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-unkempt-beauty-of-working-mans-vrsovice/olh/) and [Nusle](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-impeccable-reality-show-of-nusle/etf/) are still relatively close to the city center with reasonable rent prices. In both districts you can enjoy a walk in the park, dine in decent restaurants and go for a drink to respectable (or not) establishments.

Further from the city center, yet well accessible by public transportation, are other nice districts with moderate costs such as **Ko≈°√≠≈ôe, Michle, Podol√≠, Krƒç** or **Stra≈°nice**. 

#### A good compromise

Some of the most affordable options are found in districts on the outskirts of Prague (most of which are accessible by metro) such as **≈òepy, Prosek, Let≈àany, Zliƒç√≠n** or **Chodov**. These areas are known for housing estates called ‚Äú[panel√°ky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel%C3%A1k)‚Äù (panel buildings), built during the communist era to tackle massive housing shortages and to promote collectivism. The largest panel housing estate is [Ji≈æn√≠ Mƒõsto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C5%BEn%C3%AD_M%C4%9Bsto) (called ‚ÄúJi≈æ√°k‚Äù) housing approximately 90,000 people. 

Life in Prague‚Äôs housing estates can actually be very comfortable, with greenery and all necessary amenities (shops, schools, public services, doctors‚Äô offices, public transportation hubs) in the near vicinity. Once depressingly grey, many panel√°ky have acquired flamboyant exteriors and many dwellings have been transformed into fine examples of modern living. If you don‚Äôt mind longer commutes to the city centre, it‚Äôs worth exploring offers in these neighbourhoods.


### üõ¨ What to do upon your arrival

#### Foreign Police

It‚Äôs necessary to register with the foreign police within a set period of time depending on whether you are a non-EU or EU citizen. If you are **a citizen of the EU, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland you are required to report your presence** to the [Foreign Police Department](https://www.policie.cz/clanek/odbor-cizinecke-policie-540818.aspx) **within 30 days of entering the Czech Republic**.

**Third country nationals*** are obliged to register their accommodation address in the Czech Republic with the nearest [foreign police department](https://www.policie.cz/clanek/odbor-cizinecke-policie-540818.aspx) **within 3 working days of entering the Czech Republic**. If you have arrived in the Czech Republic to pick up a long-term or permanent residence card, you may also perform your obligation of registration at an office of the [Ministry of Interior](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/contacts.aspx), where you may also perform your obligation to provide [biometric data](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/biometric-data.aspx). 

*non-EU nationals are citizens of countries neither members of the EU, nor citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, nor their family members; the term used in legislation for this group is third country nationals.

**If you are staying in a hotel, hostel, student residence** or similar, the accommodation provider will register you at the Foreign Police for you, but only for the duration of your stay at the accommodation ‚Äì **after that you must register yourself**.

[Euraxess](https://www.euraxess.cz/czech-republic/information-assistance/visa-residence-permit) can help you with the process of registering at the Foreign Police. It‚Äôs important to notify the Foreign Police about any changes to your status or travel documents (surname, marital status, passport, purpose of stay, change of address).

Take a look at this [useful article](https://github.com/PRL-PRG/prl-prg.github.io/wiki/Local-information#foreign-police) about the Czech foreign police by one of the [computer science research teams at the Czech Technical University](https://prl-prg.github.io/).

Other things to check off:

- Check with your employer if healthcare is provided for you (it should be a part of your employment relationship), otherwise get health insurance. We recommend carrying your health insurance card with you at all times. 
- Open a bank account.
- Get a prepaid sim card from one of the Czech operators.
- Get the L√≠taƒçka (a regional transport system card for which you can buy a monthly, quarterly or annual coupon that will save you considerable time and money).

#### Rodn√© ƒç√≠slo (birth number)
Czech nationals are allocated this number at birth. It‚Äôs used for identification when dealing with government bodies, insurance providers, doctors, etc. It can potentially make bureaucratic processes easier. EU citizens staying for more than 3 months may [apply for a temporary residence permit](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/temporary-residence.aspx), upon which they are issued a rodn√© ƒç√≠slo. Non-EU citizens with permits to stay beyond 90 days can also apply for this identification number.

#### Airport

[Leti≈°tƒõ V√°clava Havla](https://www.prg.aero/en#/) (Prague Airport) is the international airport of Prague and is named after the first President of the Czech Republic.

The best way to get [from the airport using public transport](https://www.prg.aero/en/public-transport-buses) is by bus no. 119 that goes to the Veleslav√≠n metro station (Line A) or bus no. 100 that goes to the Zliƒç√≠n metro station (Line B). The 191 bus is also helpful for going to Na Kn√≠≈æec√≠, which is useful for places around Andƒõl, B≈ôevnov, Strahov, etc. You don‚Äôt have to book the bus ride in advance, but buying a ticket is mandatory. Ticket machines are located directly at bus stops and around arrival halls.

If you want to use a *taxi service*, we definitely recommend booking in advance. You will find taxis waiting at the airporport, but you are likely to pay a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù.
