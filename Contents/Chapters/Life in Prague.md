## üëçüèª Life in Prague

### What to do before your arrival

For detailed information about visa and residence permits, see section [Visa and residence permit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iPcpxQ0UPT92rINIKPU8-HMLCKl9xzAvxFvXTdWnFMU/edit#heading=h.hsgq6278i930).

[Euraxess](https://www.euraxess.cz/information/search/field_service_category/living-europe-1221/country/czech-republic-1058) is a great source and point of contact as their main mission is to help researchers who are moving to and out of the Czech Republic. Chances are you‚Äôve already been in contact with them if you‚Äôve been applying for a visa as a non-EU citizen.

- If you are **a citizen of the EU, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland** and you are planning to stay in the Czech Republic for more than 3 months, you need to apply for a <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21672749&doctype=ART">temporary residence</a>. Keep in mind that you will need proof of accommodation.
- If you are a citizen of a third country*, you need to apply for a [short-term](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21672767&doctype=ART) or [long-term](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21673057&doctype=ART) visa or for [long-term residence](https://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=21673122&doctype=ART).
  * *Non-EU nationals are citizens of countries neither members of the EU, nor citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, nor their family members; the term used in legislation for this group is third country nationals.
- Find accommodation.
- Optional but highly recommended: Find a Czech language course if it‚Äôs not provided by your employer.
- If you plan on arriving to Prague by plane, see how to get from the airport to the metro line.


### Accommodation

#### Where to look?

[Bezrealitky](https://www.bezrealitky.com/) advertises apartments for rent directly by owners so you can avoid agency commission fees. The downside is that many renters don‚Äôt reply to queries in English. The cost of the service is 99 CZK or EUR 3.5 per 3 months for a Basic account and 299 Kƒç/EUR 11 per 3 months for a Premium account. 

Sreality offers apartments for rent by owners or more frequently by real estate agencies whose agents are more likely to speak English and respond promptly. The deposit is usually 1 month's rent.

There are also several Facebook groups. Below are a few examples, however it may be useful to search and ask around for more:
- [Praha - Bydlen√≠ v Praze, Spolubydlen√≠, n√°jem, pron√°jem, podn√°jem, byt, d≈Øm](https://www.facebook.com/groups/126198231421193/)
- [FLATSHARE in PRAGUE](https://www.facebook.com/groups/524182954269921/)
- [Prague Rent a room/house/apartment/flat/accommodation/Long/short-term](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PragueRoom/)
- [Apartments for Rent in Prague](https://www.facebook.com/groups/apartmentsinprague/)

Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask your Prague colleagues and friends if they know about any available accommodation. From the experience of our interviewees, it‚Äôs quite common that you may find a room or apartment through word-of-mouth.

While you look for something permanent, you may want to opt for staying in a hotel, [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) or an apartment through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com). The Czech Academy of Sciences (AVCR) offers [Hotel Mazanka](http://www.hotel-mazanka.cz/index.html) to their international staff.

Some institutions also own their own short-term accommodation facilities. For example, Charles University has some studios for rent in Jinonice and the Institute of Computer Science of the Academy of Sciences has two studios near L√°dv√≠. Check with your institution and see what options are available.

#### A few tips for understanding the ads

In the Czech Republic, apartments are often classified according to ‚Äúdispositions‚Äù, for example **1+kk** or **2+1**. Rather than describing the size of the apartment, this tells us how many rooms the apartment has and whether the kitchen is a separate room or a kitchenette. **The first number indicates the number of rooms** in the apartment of at least 8m2 (it does not tell us the type of the room, so it can be a bedroom, living room or dining room), **while the second number or label refers to either a separate kitchen (+1) or a kitchenette/corner kitchen (+kk)**. So, whereas 2+1 indicates two rooms and a separate kitchen, 2+kk indicates two rooms, one of which features a kitchenette. **A so-called ‚Äògarsonka‚Äô is an apartment studio** very similar to 1+kk, the main difference being that in the latter, the kitchenette should be somehow separated from the rest of the room (e.g. with a bar).

### Districts of Prague

Prague is divided into 10 municipal districts (1‚Äì10), 22 administrative districts (1‚Äì22), 57 municipal parts and 112 cadastral areas. For further information see [Districts of Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Prague) on Wikipedia.

Below is a brief overview of the different popular neighbourhoods organised according to the cost of rent. Have a look at [Guide to Prague‚Äôs Neighborhoods](https://passionpassport.com/prague-neighborhood-guide/) and [Where to Live in Prague?](https://blog.foreigners.cz/where-to-live-in-prague/) for more detailed information. 

Generally, the closer you get to the city center, the higher the rent. But that does not mean that you have to forget about living in popular districts like Letn√°, Vinohrady or Dejvice. The cost of rent very much depends on the apartment size, its location in the building (one generally pays for a view) or if it has recently been renovated.

#### Upscale

[Letn√°](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-complete-guide-to-life-at-letna/unh/) is part of the [Hole≈°ovice](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-industrial-ethos-of-soon-to-be-hip-holesovice/hnh/) district. Home to Prague‚Äôs hipster community, artists and intellectuals, it‚Äôs surrounded by two beautiful parks, [Letensk√© sady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letn%C3%A1_Park) and [Stromovka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromovka), and is abounding with restaurants, bars, caf√©s and small shops. You can easily take a tram or walk to the city center. Rent in Letn√° is usually expensive, but it can be a good place to flatshare.

[Vinohrady](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-insurmountable-coolness-of-upper-vinohrady/dfg/) is one of the most popular expat districts located near the [Riegrovy sady](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/508/rieger-gardens-riegrovy-sady) (Rieger Gardens) and a great variety of restaurants, bars, pubs, caf√©s and shops. The area around [Ji≈ô√≠ho z Podƒõbrad square](https://www.prague-stay.com/lifestyle/review/1604-jiriho-z-podebrad-square), known for its large [farmer‚Äôs market](https://trhyjirak.cz/), is where you can find the most foreigners. Same as in Letn√°, one pays a premium for beauty and a convenient location close to the centre.

[Karl√≠n](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-two-faced-miracle-of-karlin/umh/), previously home to the socially disadvantaged, and literally washed out by the [floods in 2002](https://livingprague.com/prague-history/prague-flood/), has undergone a true transformation. It‚Äôs now filled with modern office and residential buildings and hip cafes, restaurants and shops and the [Karl√≠n Barracks](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/3398/karlin-barracks). It has become one of the most important business districts which naturally translates into higher costs of living.

[Dejvice](https://goout.net/en/magazine/the-inseparable-dance-of-dejvices-highs-and-lows/agg/) is located close to the Prague Castle and along with [Bubeneƒç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubene%C4%8D), it is home to most embassies situated in beautiful villas built during the [First Republic](http://www.myczechrepublic.com/czech-history/first-republic.html). It‚Äôs a pleasant and calm neighbourhood, often sought after by families and with the vast Stromovka park conveniently nearby ‚Äî and hence it‚Äôs on the pricier side.


#### The golden mean

≈Ωi≈ækov, the cheaper and grittier neighbour of Vinohrady, is very popular among young people and students; not only because it is a fun place for a night out, but also because of the Paruk√°≈ôka and V√≠tkov parks, a relatively central location and reasonable costs of living. 

Sm√≠chov is a mix of residential and office buildings, restaurants and small shops as well as one of Prague‚Äôs major shopping centers. Rent prices are relatively moderate and you can easily get to the city center by metro and tram. There are also a few nice parks and the river bank is perfect for walks.

Vr≈°ovice and Nusle are still relatively close to the city center with reasonable rent prices. In both districts you can enjoy a walk in the park, dine in decent restaurants and go for a drink to respectable (or not) establishments.

Further from the city center, yet well accessible by public transportation, are other nice districts with moderate costs such as Ko≈°√≠≈ôe, Michle, Podol√≠, Krƒç or Stra≈°nice. 

#### A good compromise

Some of the most affordable options are found in districts on the outskirts of Prague (most of which are accessible by metro) such as ≈òepy, Prosek, Let≈àany, Zliƒç√≠n or Chodov. These areas are known for housing estates called ‚Äúpanel√°ky‚Äù (panel buildings), built during the communist era to tackle massive housing shortages and to promote collectivism. The largest panel housing estate is Ji≈æn√≠ Mƒõsto (called ‚ÄúJi≈æ√°k‚Äù) housing approximately 90,000 people. 

Life in Prague‚Äôs housing estates can actually be very comfortable, with greenery and all necessary amenities (shops, schools, public services, doctors‚Äô offices, public transportation hubs) in the near vicinity. Once depressingly grey, many panel√°ky have acquired flamboyant exteriors and many dwellings have been transformed into fine examples of modern living. If you don‚Äôt mind longer commutes to the city centre, it‚Äôs worth exploring offers in these neighbourhoods.
