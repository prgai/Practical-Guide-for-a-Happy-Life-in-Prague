## üôá Notes on Czech customs, etiquette and culture shock

### Czech customs and etiquette

Perhaps some of these tips will make your acclimatisation a bit easier.

- In public transport, it‚Äôs expected to free up seats for pregnant women and the elderly (the seats closest to the exit are marked with a sticker on the window indicating priority seating).
- Before entering the metro, tram or bus, passengers are let off first.
- On metro escalators, we stand on the right side. The left side is left empty for those who want to walk up. 
- Admittedly, Czech is hard to learn, but locals appreciate every attempt by a foreigner at phrases like thank you, hello and yes/no :-)
- Service charge is generally not included in the final price of a meal and it is common to give a 10-15% tip.
- Czechs take their shoes off at the apartment entrance and swap them for cosy slippers. Some households will even have slippers for guests!

### Culture shock

What are the things that surprised our interviewees when they came to the Czech Republic? You can also check out [this article](https://blog.foreigners.cz/culture-shock-in-the-czech-republic/) by [Foreigners blog](https://blog.foreigners.cz/). 

- Having a pet dog is very common in the Czech Republic, and dogs don‚Äôt just wait at home. You will meet the furry companions in public transport, restaurants, pubs, cafes... and mind you, even the big ones.
- Czechs blow their noses in public.
- Don‚Äôt expect many American smiles when you arrive in the Czech Republic. Czechs can be somewhat rough around the edges, but don't take it personally, once you get under their thick skin, you will most likely find friends for life.
- Dealing with Czechs in public offices and healthcare can be somewhat unpleasant at times as some may not speak good English and can be rather abrupt. Don‚Äôt get discouraged, smile and persevere, for in many cases these seeming witches can turn into very helpful fairy godmothers.
- Students are expected to dress formally for entrance/state exams and thesis defenses. Yep, the whole shebang: a suit, a tie and formal shoes for the gentlemen and a skirt/dress or formal pants and a dress shirt for the ladies.
