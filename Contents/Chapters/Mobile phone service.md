## ðŸ“¶ Mobile phone service 

The largest mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic are [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.cz/en/), [O2](https://www.o2.cz/osobni/) and [T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.cz/osobni). You can either get a prepaid card or get a contract (contracts are usually signed for 24 months). Some companies and institutions also have special deals with operators, so ask about this option at your home institution if you plan to stay for longer. The price of a prepaid card depends on the services you want to use and starts at 200 CZK. 

An example of the [Prepaid Card 30 from Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.cz/pece/en/otazky/offering-tariffs-and-vodafone-cards1/prepaid-card-30/?page=0): after reaching the daily expenditure of 30 CZK you can call, send unlimited SMS and use up to 400 MB of data until midnight for free. Prices are: 3 CZK/min, 3 CZK for SMS, 3 CZK for 10 MB of data.
