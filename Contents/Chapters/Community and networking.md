Prague has a growing community of expats which is reflected in the increasing amount of networking groups, events and programmes in English. Below is a list of networking and educational organisations loosely divided into three categories. 

### Social networking

**[InterNations Prague](https://www.internations.org/prague-expats)** is a social platform where you can join [groups](https://www.internations.org/prague-expats/groups/?page=1), find [events](https://www.internations.org/prague-expats#events) (including online events) and connect with other expats. 

Another social platform is the **[Prague International Network](http://praguenetwork.com/)** that focuses on offline networking events for the international community in Prague

### Professional networking

The [Czech Centre London](http://london.czechcentres.cz/programme/page:1/) organises many interesting events in English, for example the [Science Caf√©](http://london.czechcentres.cz/programme/travel-events/science-cafe6/) ‚Äì a series of popular science presentations and talks by prominent Czech scientists and innovators that stream live on Facebook.

**[Prague Talk](https://www.radio.cz/special-podcasts/prague-talk/)** is a regular interview series by [Radio Prague International](https://english.radio.cz/) that features interesting Czech personalities. 

When there are no COVID-related lockdowns, Prague hosts a number of **science fairs** with exhibitions, screenings and stands with no admission fees. The programmes are largely in Czech, but often those working at stands speak in English so it can still be a nice opportunity. Some of these fairs include [The Week of Science and Technology](https://www.tydenvedy.cz/en/) (T√Ωden vƒõdy), [Science Fair](http://veletrhvedy.cz/en/) (Veletrh vƒõdy), [Week of the Brain](https://www.avcr.cz/en/public/public-events/brain-awareness-week) (T√Ωden mozku). There are also excellent scientific programmes and initiatives, such as [ELI Beamlines](https://www.eli-beams.eu/) that brings together international researchers and sometimes publishes interesting events on their website.
